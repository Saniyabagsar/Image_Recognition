 Image Recognition System

This project is an image classification system built using TensorFlow and Keras. It can classify images of cats and dogs with a trained deep learning model.
 
 Features

- Classifies images as Cat or Dog
- Trained using TensorFlow datasets
- Built and tested in Google Colab
- Can be extended with a Flask web app

 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- OpenCV (for preprocessing)
- Matplotlib

  How to Use

1. Open the notebook `train_model_colab.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells to:
   - Download dataset
   - Train model
   - Save and test predictions
3. Upload any image and classify it using the trained model.
